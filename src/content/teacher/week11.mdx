title: Week 11 Teacher notes

---

Try to get the student projects specifications graded as quickly as you can so that they have feedback to work with. 

The readings this week deal with authentication...specifically looking at OAuth and JWT. There is an additional assignment this week to have the students implement authentication in their project using the Better-Auth library. This is a great opportunity to show them how to use an AI agent to help them understand the documentation and implement the authentication system. The documentation for Better-Auth is pretty good, but it can still be a bit overwhelming if you are new to authentication. An AI agent can help break down the documentation into more manageable pieces and provide code snippets to help with the implementation.

The instructions for the Better-Auth assignment outline some specifics on how to leverage AI to help, but it would be helpful to spend some time modeling this for the students in your lab this week.
