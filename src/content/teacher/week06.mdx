title: Week 06 Teacher notes

---

Back to Frontend this week and will be introducing a component based framework. The students are supposed to work thruogh the first half of a Svelte tutorial. I would suggest that you go through the tutorial yourself before the week starts so that you can help them with any issues they might run into.

For the lab you might do something like this:

1. Start by having the students open up the Svelte [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl). This will allow you to introduce the components without having to worry initially about tooling.
2. Start by explaining the parts of a Svelte component. Script, Markup, styles. Mention that one of the big things we gain from a tool like Svelte (and the other frontend frameworks) is <em>reactivity</em>. Make some changes to the default, add a style block, point out the JS variable that is inserted into the markup.
3. Show how we can make a request to an API to bring some data in. You could use [https://dummyjson.com/posts](https://dummyjson.com/posts) to get some fake blog post records. Create a function to make the fetch, then you could make an `async init()` function, call init() directly, or you could introduce `onMount()`.
4. The init function needs to do the following: get the posts data, and set a state variable called `filteredPosts` equal to the list of all the posts.
5. Next talk about displaying the post. This is something we may want to do in multiple places, so we can create another component to make it easy to re-use. Add a new file called <kbd>Post.svelte</kbd>. Add a script block and a variable called `post` to act as a prop. Stop and talk about props. Then add some markup to display the post...something like
```html
<div>
    <h2>{post.title}</h2>
    <ul>
    {#each post.tags as tag}
        <li>{tag}</li>
    {/each}
    </ul>
    <p>{post.body}</p>
</div>
``` 
6. Next use an `{#each}` block and our new component to display the posts.
7. You may want to stop and have the students create one more component `TagList.svelte` for practice. Then have them replace the code in Post.svelte with the new component.
8. If you have more time Style the page, and if things go really well you could get an early start on binding and events and add a search field. (see week 5 for the code)

See below for the finished code:
```js
<script>
// App.svelte
import Post from './Post.svelte';
import {onMount} from 'svelte'

// declare reactive variables
let posts = [];
let filteredPosts = [];
    
async function getPosts() {
    const res = await fetch('https://dummyjson.com/posts/')
    return res.json()
}
async function init() {
    posts = await getPosts();
    console.log(posts)
    filteredPosts = posts.posts;
}

init()
// 	onMount(init)
</script>

<main>
<h1>My Blog</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Posts</h2>
{#each filteredPosts as post}
        <Post {post} layoutClass="post" />
{/each}
</section>
</main>

<style>
main {
    font-family: courier;
}
section {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 1em;
}
h2 {
    grid-column: 1/3;
    justify-self: center
}
/* 	We want the parent to have layout control over the child. We can do this by passing a class (post) in as a prop, then add the :global flag to make this class able to apply */
:global(.post) {
    max-width: 66ch;
    border: 1px solid
    
}
</style>
```
```svelte
<script>
// Post.svelte
<script>
import TagList from './TagList.svelte';
export let post = {};
</script>

<h2>
    {post.title}
</h2>
<TagList tags={post.tags} />
<p>
{post.body}
</p>
 ```
 ```svelte
// TagList.svelte
<script>
export let tags = [];
</script>

<ul>
{#each tags as tag}
    <li>{tag}</li>
{/each}
</ul>

<style>
ul {
    display: flex;
    list-style-type: none;
}
li {
    padding: .2em .5em;
    border: 1px solid;
}
</style>
```
