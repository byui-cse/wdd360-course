title: Week 08 Teacher notes

---

The students should be working hard on Sleepoutside. They will also have the last team activity this week.

For the lab you could either just take questions on issues students are having with Sleepoutside or you could pick any of the topics from the readings that you think would be helpful to review. Most students do not have much experience with `formData` in particular. Clarification on CORS or this would probably also be helpful.

The students also have a midterm checkin to complete this week. The students should rate themselves from 1-4 on the course outcomes. Before they do that however they should complete an exercise found in week 8 of the student content. The exercise is to help the students accurately assess their own skills and progress in the course. You might say a few words introducing the exercise.
