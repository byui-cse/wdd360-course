title: Week 12 Teacher notes

---

Students should be spending most of their time working with their teams on their projects. The readings this week are focused on testing. 

During your lab take some time to talk about testing. Give some examples of how you have approached testing in your work. This could also be a great opportunity to show the students how to use AI to help them write tests for their projects. You could have them use an AI agent to generate unit tests for some of their utility functions, or you could have them use an AI agent to generate integration tests for some of the user flows in their application. The Playwright documentation has some good best practices for writing tests that you could also review with the students.
