title: Week 04 Teacher notes

---

We switch to the backend this week. The students should be comfortable with setting up a basic Node application and using Express to create a simple server because of their experience in CSE 340. However, they may not have experience with using a NoSQL database like MongoDB, so be prepared to spend some time going over that. 

Make sure to remind them early in the week to set up a time to complete the team activity together

For the lab this week, I would suggest talking about the differences between relational and non-relational databases. Specifically, where data modeling is concerned. You might also pull up the server code from the [Team 3](../../prove/team-3.mdx) activity and walk them through the files and how the server is set up.
