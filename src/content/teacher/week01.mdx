title: Week 01 Teacher notes

---

The most important task this week is to get the course introduced, and get the students into teams with the development environment set up.

If you do a lab this week, I would suggest going overe the [Javascript Review](../ponder/js-review.mdx) activity. This will give you a chance to see where the students are at with their Javascript knowledge, and give them a chance to ask questions about anything they are unsure of.

Make sure to spend some time going over the [Course Setup](../resources/course-setup.html) activity to ensure that all students have their development environment set up correctly. Talk about the importance of using Git and Github for version control, and make sure they understand how to use these tools...especially branching which may be new to them.

Finally, spend some time discussing the team projects that will be happening throughout the course. Go over the [Working with Groups](https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/working-with-groups.html) resource to help students understand how to work effectively in teams. Emphasize the importance of communication and collaboration in these projects.
