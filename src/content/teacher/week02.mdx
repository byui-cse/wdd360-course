title: Week 02 Teacher notes

---

The Team activity this week has the students copy the starter code for the Sleepoutside project and get it set up in their local development environment. This is a great opportunity to discuss the importance of setting up a proper development environment, and to ensure that all students are comfortable with the tools they will be using throughout the course.

Make sure to remind them early in the week to set up a time to complete the team activity together

For the lab this week, I would suggest going over the [NodeJs Review](../ponder/js-backend-review.mdx) activity or the [Typescript Review](../ponder/ts-review.mdx) activity. This will give you a chance to see where the students are at with their Javascript knowledge, and give them a chance to ask questions about anything they are unsure of.
