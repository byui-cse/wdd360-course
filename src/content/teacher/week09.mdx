title: Week 09 Teacher notes

---

The students should be working hard on Sleepoutside. This is the last week so you should remind them that they need to have at least 12 points completed in Trello by the end of the week.

For the lab you could either just take questions on issues students are having with Sleepoutside or you could pick any of the topics from the readings that you think would be helpful to review. Closures and higher order functions in general can be hard for students to wrap their heads around so that might be a good topic to review.

You could also do a review of the check-in exercise from last week.
