title: Week 05 Teacher notes

---

We continue with backend, this time addressing API design.

Make sure to remind them early in the week to set up a time to complete the team activity together

For the lab this week, I would suggest talking about the different approaches to API design. You might refer to the [Rethinking REST](https://kieranpotts.com/rethinking-rest) article. Basically most APIs that we call RESTful are not truly RESTful...and that is ok. Then I would open up the [API design](../../ponder/api-design.mdx) activity and talk about potential gotchas they might run into.
