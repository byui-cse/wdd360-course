title: Week 03 Teacher notes

---

The Team activity this week throws the students into Astro. We will take the code they were given and convert it into an Astro application. 

Make sure to remind them early in the week to set up a time to complete the team activity together

For the lab this week, I would suggest going over the [Astro](../ponder/astro.mdx) activity. You can go over any common gotchas that students may have with Astro, and give them a chance to ask questions about anything they are unsure of. This will also give you a chance to see where the students are at with their understanding of Astro, and to identify any areas where they may need additional support.
