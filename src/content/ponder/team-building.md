## Introduction

You will be working with a team of 3-4 students for both of the major assignments for this course. This activity will have each team run through a few exercises to help them to get to know each other, and set some ground rules for how the team will operate. Spending this time now can save lots of time and frustration throughout the semester.

## **01** Meet your teammates

After forming your team, spend some time learning a little about each other. Here is a list of questions to get you started:

- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What are your interests?
- What is your favorite programming language?
- What do you hope to get out of this course?
- What has your experience with teamwork been in the past?
- What are your strengths and weaknesses?
- What can we do to make this team work well?
- What is the best way to communicate with you?
- What are your concerns about this course?

## **02** Team Management

Review the following article and discuss together: [Making Teams Work](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/team-work/).

Your team should use Github to manage your code. You will create the first shared repository for the course in the first Team activity.  You can however get a few other things done to prepare:

1. Agree how the team will communicate with each other, and exchange any info required to make that work. There will be team in MS Teams setup for the course. Talk to the instructor if you would like a channel for your team there. Whether you are using Teams or some other method for communicating you should also establish *how often* team members are expected to check in.
2. For managing the tracking and assignment of tasks we will be using a tool called [Trello](https://trello.com). Each person should create a free account. We will be using a Trello board to manage the team project. One person in the team should visit this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KsrYWMaY/sleepoutsidev2), and [copy](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards) it to their account. Then that person should invite the other team members to the board so they can edit it.
3. Discuss how you would like to work together. Will you use a peer programming model or work more independently?
4. Finally discuss what potential issues might arise in the team and discuss ways of addressing those concerns.

## **03** Brainstorm

Starting in week 9 we will begin working on a project of the team's choosing. To help prepare for that make a list of at least 15 ideas for a web application. The sky is the limit as you make this list. Put anything that comes to mind that sounds interesting. Feel free to leverage generative AI if you are struggling to come up with ideas.

Once you have the initial list it is time to narrow it down. As you review your list keep the following in mind:

1. Your interests and passions
2. The requirements of the project
3. Your team's strengths and weaknesses
4. The time it will take to complete the project
5. The potential for learning and growth
6. The potential for fun and enjoyment
7. Data/API availability
8. Complexity of the project

From now until week 9 you should continue negotiating with your partners to remove ideas until there is one left. This is the idea you will prepare a proposal for. 

> If you get up to 7-8 ideas and find one that the entire team is really excited about...you can probably stop generating ideas :)

## Submission

Submit the following in Ilearn:

1. The names of the team members (you can give a team name as well if you would like)
2. A list of the 15 ideas for a web application.
3. A brief description of how you plan to work together as a team including your communication plan.
