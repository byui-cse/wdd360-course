## Introduction

We have had some experience building component based applications using two diffeent frameworks now: Astro and Svelte. There are many other frameworks out there as well. React, Vue, Angular, Solid, and many more.

As part of your exploration this week you should have chosen one of the other frameworks and done some research. To finish out this activity find a turotial for that framework and complete it. Many of the Frameworks have tutorials as part of their documentation.

If you would like to dig deeper into the framework you have chosen you could also re-build the components we built in Svelte using that framework: Loginform, and the editable fields
