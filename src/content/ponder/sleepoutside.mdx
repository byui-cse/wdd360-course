## Introduction
Each team has made a copy of a list of tasks in a Trello board. We have been working on a few of those tasks as we have completed the team activities each week, but there is a lot left to do. 

You each should also have completed one of those cards on your own in the [First Trello Card](./first-trello-card) activity. For the next three weeks each team's focus should be to get as many of the remaining tasks completed as possible to complete this project.

## **01** Workflow

We will still do a team activity each week, but the rest of your time should be used in completing the individual tasks in the Trello list. You should consider following the workflow below:

1.  Choose a Trello card, assign yourself to it, and move to "Doing"
2.  Make a branch
3.  Complete the work
4.  Lint and format
5.  Commit and push
6.  Move the Trello card to "Done"
7.  Make a pull request for your branch
8.  Let your group know there is a pull request waiting
9.  Another team member should review the pull request in GitHub and, if everything looks good, Merge the request. I would also recommend deleting the old branch as part of that process as well.



## **02** Choosing a task

Some of the tasks are frontend tasks, some are backend tasks, and some are both. You should try and complete a balance of both frontend and backend tasks.

You will also notice that there are labels on the tasks. These indicate complexity and have a number of points attached. 

- Green is the easiest and worth 1 point.
- Yellow is medium complexity and worth 2 points.
- Orange is hard and worth 3 points.

Each team member should have a goal to complete at least 12 points. That means you should try and get 4 points worth of cards done each week for the next three weeks.

Because not all teams will have the same number of members, it is not required for each team to complete all of the cards...though it is a good goal!

## **03** Complete a weekly standup with the instructor

Each week the team should arrange a time to have a progress meeting with the instructor. This is an opportunity to discuss any issues that may be coming up, and also to get feedback on your work.
