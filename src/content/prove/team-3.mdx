description: This activity outlines a recommended pace for your project to stay on track.
time: 1 hour
---

## Requirements
To begin do the following:

1. Create a new node project (pnpm init)
2. Install express and nodemon with npm or pnpm. (pnpm i express nodemon)
3. Create a file to serve as our application entrypoint. (server.js)
4. Setup some scripts to be able to easily run our application with nodemon. (remember to add "type": "module" as well so we can use ESModules)
5. Using express start up a web server listening on port 3000
6. Create a route to the webroot (/) that just returns a simple message.
7. Run your server and test your route.

import Details from '../../components/Details.astro'

<Details summary="server.js">
```javascript
import express from "express";

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```
</Details>
This project will be completed in a team of 2 students. After forming your team you will be responsible to plan and complete a web application as a showcase that demonstrates your mastery of the topics taught during this course. Your web application can take many different forms, but there is a list of requirements that each app must include:

- At least one detailed, validated form
- Local storage for persistence
- Fetching data from an API or json file.
- Drop-down menu
- CSS Animation
- Responsive design
- Good user experience (UX) and accessibility
- URL parameters (data that is passed from page to page in an app through the URL, for example https://example.com/page2.html?id=34 Send the `id` of `34` to the code running at `page2.html`)
- Use of modules for organization

## Checkpoint

By the end of this unit (Unit 4) it is recommended that you switch out the static content for dynamically generated markup using data retrieved from an API or json file. You may also start on the code to store and retrieve data in localStorage.

Keep the requirements list above in mind as you code up your application. 

## Meet with the instructor

Each unit your team should meet with the instructor to review progress and discuss potential problems. Your instructor will give you more details about how this is to happen. It is your responsibility to make sure this meeting does occur!
