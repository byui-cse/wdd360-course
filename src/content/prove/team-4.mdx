## Overview
This activity will continue our work from the previous activity and finish setting up the backend for our application.

## Instructions
Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code. Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the most out of this activity, do not look at the examples until your group has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example, resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to get correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it done.

## Core Requirements


### **01** Finish `initDb.js`

### **02** Review OpenApi docs
### **03** Build `GET /products` endpoint
### **04** Build login endpoints
### **05** Deploy Backend

## Instructor's Solution

As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.

Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.

After working with your team for the one hour activity, click here for the instructor's solution: [server](https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutsideServer/tree/team-03/src) and [client](https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutsideClient/tree/team-03/src).

## Make a pull request.

After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's solution, and gotten your code working, the driver should commit and push their changes (don't forget to lint and format your code before committing!), then submit a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally, someone should move the Trello card to "Done".

## Submission

When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.
