title: Sleepoutside - Team 4
description: Finish setting up the backend.
time: 2 hours

import Details from '../../components/Details.astro'

## Overview
This activity will continue our work from the previous activity and finish setting up the backend for our application.

## Instructions
Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code. Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the most out of this activity, do not look at the examples until your group has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example, resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to get correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it done.

## Core Requirements


### **01** Finish `initDb.js`

We began created a script to setup our database, and seed the products table. This will allow us to reset our database anytime we need to easily. We are not done however. We need to add a few more things to our database setup script:

- Drop/Add an `alerts` collection
- Drop/Add an `orders` collection
- Drop/Add a `users` collection.
- Add a user to the users collection for testing
- Add indexes on `products` and `users`

When we add the test user we will want to hash the password before storing it. Hashing is a process where we take a string of text (in this case our password) and turn it into something else. This is done so that we can store the password in a way that makes it difficult for someone to figure out what the original password was. We will use a library called `argon2` for this. You will need to install it into your project: `(p)npm install argon2` Then import it into the `init-db.js` file: `import * as argon2 from "argon2";`. To use it to hash a password you can do the following: `const hashedPassword = await argon2.hash("password");`. 

A user should have at least the following fields:

- name (string)
- email (string, unique)
- password_hash (hashed string)
- createdAt (date)
- updatedAt (date)

>Indexes on database table are critical for good performance. Indexes allow us to quickly find data in a table without having to scan every row of the table. This is especially important for large tables with many rows and columns. You want indexes on columns that we will query on frequently. You can read more about indexes [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/). 

We can easily add indexes in our setup script by using the `createIndex` method on our collection: `await productsCollection.createIndex({ name: 1 });`. Add indexes on the `products` collection on `name`, `description`, `category`, `id`. Add indexes on the `users` collection on `username`, `email`.

Test your script when you are done to make sure there are no errors.

### **02** Setup OpenApi docs

Unless you are following strict REST principles in the design of your API (under strict RESt APIS should be self documenting. Each call should give you guidance on what to do next) documentation is very important. Most APIS do not follow strict REST but are often referred to as "REST-ish". The API for SleepOutside is no exception. We can use OpenApi to document our API and make it self documenting. If you have a Swagger config file providing documentation for our API becomes very simple by using a node module called [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express). You should have generated part of the specification for our API in an activity earlier this week. But since you did not complete the specs for the whole API, a complete specification will be provided.

Download this [swaggerDesign.json](/files/swaggerDesign.json) file and place it into the `src` folder on your server. To finish the setup do the following:

1. Install swagger-ui-express and types for it.
2. Create a `swaggerRoutes.mts` file in the routes folder.
3. Import Router, swagger-ui-express, and swaggerDesign.json into our `swaggerRoutes.mts` file.
4. Setup the Router object as we have done before.
5. Setup the swagger-ui middleware: `router.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));`
6. Export your router.
7. Import the swaggerRouter into `routes/index.mts` and add it as a dependency.

>When importing our `swaggerDesign.json` file you will notice that Typescript will complain. If we check the [Node json-modules docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#json-modules) we can see that we can import JSON directly...but that we need to add `with {type: json}` to our import statement.
>
> You will also need to go into the `tsconfig.json` file and uncomment the line that looks like this: `"resolveJsonModule": true`

### **03** Update types and JSONSchema files.
While we are at it. Our type and schema files in our projects are incomplete. We will update them now to contain the correct types and schemas. Copy/paste the following code into your `types.ts` file in both the backend and frontend codebase.

<Details summary="types.ts">
```ts
import { ObjectId } from "mongodb";

export interface Product {
  _id: string;
  id: string;
  isClearance: boolean;
  category: string;
  isNew: boolean;

  reviews: {
    reviewsUrl: string;
    reviewCount: number;
    averageRating: number;
  };

    primaryExtraLarge: string;
    extraImages: {
      title: string;
      src: string;
    }[];
  };
  sizesAvailable: {
    zipper: string[];
  };
  colors: Color[];
  descriptionHtmlSimple: string;
  suggestedRetailPrice: number;
  brand: Brand;
  listPrice: number;
  finalPrice: number;
}

export interface Color {
  colorCode: string;
  colorName: string;
  colorChipImageSrc: string;
  colorPreviewImageSrc: string;
}

export interface Brand {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  productsUrl: string;

  name: string;
}


export interface User {
    _id: ObjectId;
    email: string;
    password: string;
  name: string;
  address: Address;
  phoneNumbers: PhoneNumber[];
  cart: CartItem[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
 export interface CartItem {
    productId: string;
    productName: string;
    price: number;
    finalPrice: number;
    productImageSrc: string;
    productUrl: string;
    productCategory: string;
    productColor: Color;
    productSize: string;
    
  }
export interface PhoneNumber {
    type: string;
    number: string;
  }

export interface Address {
  street: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  zipCode: string;
  country: string;
};

  export interface Order {
    _id: string;
    userId: string;
    totalAmount: number;
    status: "pending" | "processing" | "shipped" | "delivered";
    paymentMethod: string;
    shippingAddress: Address;
    orderItems: CartItem[];
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
    totalPrice: number;
    shippingCost: number;
    taxAmount: number;
  }

  export interface Alert {
    _id: string;
    title: string;
    type: 'promotion' | 'info' | 'warning';
    status: 'active' | 'inactive';
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
  }
   
```
</Details>

Then create a file (if it does not already exist) in the server codebase in `src/database/json-schema.ts` with the following code:

### **04** Build `GET /products` endpoint

We are finally ready to build some more API endpoints. Last week we built a simple `GET /products` endpoint. If you check the new API documentation we just setup for that endpoint you will see that the endpoint is supposed to accept a `query` parameter. This query parameter is supposed to be used for filtering the products that are returned by the endpoint. Ours does not do this yet.

Update the `GET /products` endpoint to accept some query parameters. Check the documentation to see which ones. Remember that express places and query params sent with a request in `req.params`. You can find more information about this in the express documentation.

You will need to provide a type in the `getAllProducts` function when you pass the query params in.  All of the properties are optional, but if they exist they will be strings. So you should probably add something like this to the `models/types.mts` file:
```javascript
  // create an generic interface for our query parameters. This will make it easier to type check and validate the data we receive from the client. If we end up using query parameters for other routes we can modify it to include other fields.
// this works because they are all optional. But if for example a limit exists it will have to  be a string.
export interface QueryParams {
  category?: string;
  q?:string;
  limit?: string;
  offset?: string;
  fields?: string;
}
```

Then the function declaration will look something like this:
```javascript
export async function getAllProducts(query:QueryParams): Promise<{totalCount: number; data: Product[] | null}> {
    // all the codes
}
```
Note the return type. It is an object wrapped in a Promise. The Promise wrapper happens because it is an `async` function. We will send back both the products and the total number of matches to any query that might be sent. This will be necessary to implement our pagination.

Here is an outline you can follow to direct your efforts:

1. Notice that the `find({})` method we are using in the `getAllProducts` method takes an object as an argument. If we check out the [MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#mongodb-method-db.collection.find) You can see that we can pass in something like: `{name: "Some string"}` and it will filter on that.
2. You should also poke around in those docs to see how limiting and offsetting work. 
3. Start with the `q` search. For now we will search on the `name` and `descriptionHtmlSimple` fields. Check to see if you got a `q` param, if you do then build out a `find` variable that you will pass into the `find()` method later.
4. Next check to see if a `category` was passed in. Treat it the same as `q`
5. Make sure to update your mongodb query to use your find object, and limit and offset. You should also add a second query to get the totalCount using the same    `find` object. (you can get the count of total records with `await collection.countDocuments({query object})`)

>Notice that at the end of our query we call `toArray()` to convert our find object into an array. This is because the `find` method returns a cursor, which is a special type of object that allows you to iterate over all of the results in your collection. Most of the time we can just convert directly, but sometimes we may need to modify our results in some way before we use it. 
>
>For example the last query we need to implement is the ability to restrict the results sent back to a specific list of fields. It would look something like this: `?fields=name,finalPrice` which would return only the `name` and `finalPrice` fields. The projection param specifies which fields to return in MongoDB. You can find more information on how to do this in the [MongoDB projection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#projections) 
6. Remove the `toArray()` from the end of our query.
8. Check to see if we have a `fields` param. If so convert your field string into an object that looks like this: `{name: 1, finalPrice: 1}`. This is something that we will probably need to do elsewhere so encapsulate this in a function called `formatFields(fields:string)` then create a files called `services/utils.mts`, place the function there and export it.
9. Use the fields object to limit your results. (`cursor.project(fields))
10. Call `toArray()` to convert your cursor into an array. 
11. Return the totalCount and any products found.
11. In the route method when you get the data back from the model function you should format and send the data as a JSON object with `count`, `next` and `previous` fields, along with an array of objects that contain all of the product information. 
sults.

If you look closely at the response for our Products endpoint you will notice that it should send back something like this:

```javascript
{
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
           // product details
        }
    ]
}
```

<Details summary="Hints">

1. After making most of the changes above your initial query should look like this:
```javascript
const cursor = await mongodb.getDb().collection<Product>("products").find(find).skip(offset).limit(limit);
```
2. Then after you have converted your field filter into the correct format you would do this to finish off:
```javascript
if(fieldFilters) {
        cursor.project(fieldFilters);
    }
    const data = await cursor.toArray();
    return data;
```
3. If Typescript complains about your `find` object, you may want to define an interface for it:
```javascript
interface Find {
    name?:string,
    descriptionHtmlSimple?:string,
    category?:string,
}
... later when you declare your find variable
const find:Find = {};

```
4. Building out the pagination wrapper is something that we will need to do more than once...so it makes sense to put it in a function that we can re-use. Add this function to `utils.mts` as well and export it, then use it in your products route:
```javascript
// remember we created a QueryParams interface earlier in types.mts? Import it and use it here again
export function buildPaginationWrapper(totalCount:number, query:QueryParams) {
    // here we check to see if there is a limit...if yes convert it to a number, if no set it to the default of 20
    const limit= query.limit? parseInt(query.limit) : 20;
    const offset= query.offset? parseInt(query.offset) : 0;
    const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalCount / limit);
    const currentPage = Math.ceil(offset / limit)+1;
    const hasPreviousPage = currentPage > 1;
    console.log(currentPage, totalPages);
    const hasNextPage = currentPage < totalPages;
    let next, prev;
    // create a new URLSearchParams object from the query parameters. This will make it easy to modify the fields we need to, while passing all the others on.
    // This is a bit of a hack because we can't use the query object directly in our URLSearchParams constructor.
    const params = new URLSearchParams(query as Record<string, any>);
  if (hasPreviousPage) {
    params.set("offset", (offset - limit).toString());
    prev = `/?${params}`;
  }
  if (hasNextPage) {
    params.set("offset", (offset + limit).toString());
    next = `/?${params}`;
  }
       
  return {
        count: totalCount, 
        prev: prev || null, 
        next: next || null, 
        results: [] as any
  }
}
```

</Details>

### **05** Deploy Backend

We have already deployed our frontend...on Netlify. For Node that would not be the best choice. Instead we will deploy to a service called [Render](https://render.com/). The person who created the server repo in Github should complete this part.

1. Open up the [Render First Deploy](https://render.com/docs/your-first-deploy) instructions and start following them.
2. Choose "Web Service" for the type of app.
3. After linking your Github account choose the correct repo.
4. Verify the build command uses the correct package manager (npm or pnpm)
5. Change the "Start Command" to `(p)npm run start`
6. Set the environment variables. (You will need `MONGO_URI`, `PORT`, and `MONGO_DATABASE`)
7. Save your setup, then once you can see the Dashboard for you project click on the "Connect" button. There will be a list of ip addresses. Copy them then login in the MongoDB Atlas account your team is using. On the left sidebar find the "Network Access" menu item. Add the IP addresses from Render to the list of allowed IPs.
8. On the project Dashboard for render click on "Manual Deploy". Wait until it finishes, then try browsing to your app address.

Once you have your server running on Render, we will need to make a change to our Netlify site to point it to our new backend server. The person who created the Netlify account should log in, then goto the correct project and select "Site Configuration". Goto the Environment Variables section. check to see if you have a `VITE_SERVER_URL` defined. If you do then update it to the URL for you render server. If you do not then create it and set it.

Test to make sure everything is working.

## Instructor's Solution

As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.

Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.

After working with your team for the one hour activity, click here for the instructor's solution: [server](https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutsideServer/tree/team-04/src).

## Make a pull request.

After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's solution, and gotten your code working, the driver should commit and push their changes (don't forget to lint and format your code before committing!), then submit a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally, someone should move the Trello card to "Done".

## Submission

When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.
