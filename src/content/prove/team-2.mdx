## Requirements

This project will be completed in a team of 2 students. After forming your team you will be responsible to plan and complete a web application as a showcase that demonstrates your mastery of the topics taught during this course. Your web application can take many different forms, but there is a list of requirements that each app must include:

- At least one detailed, validated form
- Local storage for persistence
- Fetching data from an API or json file.
- Drop-down menu
- CSS Animation
- Responsive design
- Good user experience (UX) and accessibility
- URL parameters (data that is passed from page to page in an app through the URL, for example https://example.com/page2.html?id=34 Send the `id` of `34` to the code running at `page2.html`)
- Use of modules for organization

## Checkpoint

By the end of this unit (Unit 3) it is recommended that you have most of the HTML and CSS written for your application. In order to meet this checkpoint it is recommended that you use static content hard coded into the HTML. You should make note of where you will need to switch that out for dynamically generated markup later.

Keep the requirements list above in mind as you code up the HTML and CSS of your application. 

## Meet with the instructor

Each unit your team should meet with the instructor to review progress and discuss potential problems. Your instructor will give you more details about how this is to happen. It is your responsibility to make sure this meeting does occur!
