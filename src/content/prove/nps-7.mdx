title: NPS - part 7
description: This activity will have you use the free National Park Service api to recreate a simplified version of an NPS website for the park or monument of your choice. Part seven will be the last part. We will create detail pages for each of the visitor centers.
time: 3 hours
---

## Instructions

Complete the following assignment individually. Feel free however to work together with your classmates to accomplish the task. You are all solving the same problems and have different insights.

## **01** Review the provided screenshots

For the last part of this project we will create detail pages for each of the Visitor centers. We need to be strategic about this though. While some parks don't have a ton of visitor centers, others do. Manually creating a page for each of the centers at Yellowstone for example with it's eleven would be a fair amount of work. Since the pages for each visitor center are quite similar, we can leverage Javascript to create one HTML page as a template, and URL parameters to send in an identifier for the center we want to display.

We will be creating a simplified version of the offical page again. Here is the page for the [Canyon Visitor Center](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/canyonvc.htm) in Yellowstone. Review the page to get a feel for what the goal is. Then review the following screenshots to understand how the changes we will make for our version.

import Figure from "../../components/Figure.astro";

<Figure src="/images/nps-visitor-center.webp" alt="Visitor Center detail page">Visitor Center detail page</Figure>

>The screenshot does not show all of the accordians open. You should style them similar to the [official pages](https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/albright-visitor-center.htm)

Remember to type `npm run start` to start up your development server. 

## **02** Update the conditions.html page

On the Conditions/alerts page (`conditions.html`) we added a list of the visitor centers. We need to update that list to be links. Each visitor center will actually link to the same HTML file, but we will add specific information for the particular center in the URL through a [URL Search Parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams).

Create a new HTML file called `visitor-center.html`. You may want to start with copy/pasting the HTML out of one of the other files as a starting point. The `header` and `footer` will be the same, but clear out `main`.

 Then update the template that creates the list of visitor centers on the `conditions.html` page. It should turn the visitor center name into a link. As you construct you links, think about how we will identify the center. You may need to goto the [NPS API Documentation](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/) to remember what data was sent back from the visitor center endpoint. What property can we use to uniquely identify the centers?

*After* you have completed your version of this step, take a look at the example below.

<details>

<summary>Example step 2</summary>

```javascript
export function visitorCenterTemplate(center) {
  return `<li class="visitor-center">
  <h4><a href="visitor-center.html?id=${center.id}">${center.name}</a></h4>
  <p>${center.description}</p>
  <p>${center.directionsInfo}</p>
  </li>`;
}
```

</details>

## **03** Retrieve the URL parameters

The next thing we need to do is to write the Javascript to retrieve the data sent in the URL. Create a file called `visitor-center.js` in that file create a function called `getParam(param)`. That function needs to do the following:

1. Get the search string from the `location` object.
2. Create a new `URLSearchParams` object from the search string.
3. Return the value of the specified parameter.

After creating your version of the function you should use it to get the id of the visitor center. Store it in a variable. Feel free to check out the instructor solution below to compare or troubleshoot.

<details>
<summary>Step 3 example</summary>

```javascript
function getParam(param) {
    const search = location.search;
    const params = new URLSearchParams(search);
    return params.get(param);
}
```

</details>

## **04** Retrieve the visitor center data from the API

Now that we know which center we are interested in, we can retrieve the data. Write a new function in the `parkService.mjs` file called `getParkVisitorCenterDetails(id)` It will actually look pretty similar to the existing `getParkVisitorCenters` function.

Make the changes to get the function to work.

>Hopefully your first thought here was to go review the NPS documentation to see how to make a call with a visitor center id. Go take a look if you have not already.
>
>You might be surprised to note that there does not seem to be an option to use id! It is not listed as an option, but it actually works to do something like this: `visitorcenters?id=longidstring`
>
>The next question though is: should we use undocumented features of APIS? There is some risk with doing this. If the feature is not in the documentation, it might suddenly change or even disappear! In this case however, the risk is low. There is very little chance that the `id` field will change or go away.
>
>If we had another option we would take it, but `id` really is the best thing to use here.

Return to the `visitor-center.js` file. Import your new function, as well as the other functions we need to setup the header and footer of the site. Call all the functions and check to make sure that everything is working correctly.

<details>
<summary>Step 4 example</summary>

### parkService.mjs

```javascript
export async function getParkVisitorCenterDetails(id) {
  const parkData = await getJson(`visitorcenters?id=${id}`);
  return parkData.data[0];
}
```

### visitor-center.js

```javascript
import setHeaderFooter from "./setHeaderFooter.mjs";
import { getParkData, getParkVisitorCenterDetails } from "./parkService.mjs";

function getParam(param) {
  const search = location.search;
  const params = new URLSearchParams(search);
  return params.get(param);
}

async function init() {
  const parkData = await getParkData();
  const id = getParam("id");
  const centerDetails = getParkVisitorCenterDetails(id);
  setHeaderFooter(parkData);
}

init();
```

</details>

## **05** Write/generate the HTML for the `visitor-center.html` page

We are now ready to build out our new page. We will build out the following sections in `main`:

1. The name of the visitor center should be at the top of the page.
2. The first section will be an image and a paragraph of text that describes the visitor center.
3. The second section will be a collection of accordians: Addresses, Directions, Amenities, Contact Information. Only one accordian should be able to be open at a time.
4. And finally the last section will be a gallery of images


All of this information is in the data we just retrieved from the API. All of the icons you need (see the screenshot above) are in the `sprite.symbol.svg` file. Just to save you some time here are the ids: 
"ranger-station", "heading-icon_map-pin", "directions", "heading-icon_info", "phone", "camera-alt".

In order to save your time to work on the CSS and the Javascript, you have permission to open up the Example code section below and copy/paste the HTML there into your `visitor-center.html` file directly. Make sure to review what you have been given to understand the structure. Then move on to the next step.

## **06** Style the new page

You were given a bunch of HTML in the previous step that you have hopefully reviewed. You will notice that it does not contain the real information, but just placeholder text instead. We will replace that in the next step. It does provide enough structure for us however to be able to add the CSS necessary to style it according to the mockups you were provided above. Style the page now. Feel free to add more classes if needed, or even change up the HTML structure as you do this.

Much of what you need to do is just make things the right size, and get the padding and margin right. On the image gallery to get the images to crop to a square with CSS look at the [object-fit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) property.

>The mockup above does vary in a few ways from the original. One of those is in how the markers on the accordian boxes that show if it is open or closed are styled. The example below contains a solution to change our default `details` styling to look more like the one on the official page. Look it over if you are interested to see how that would be done.

<details>

<summary>Step 6 Example</summary>

### CSS

```css
/* visitor center styles */

.vc-name {
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--bs-gray-400);
  padding-bottom: 1em;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}
.vc-name svg {
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
}
.vc-info figure {
  margin: 1em 3em;
}
.vc-info figcaption {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
.vc-info figcaption > span {
  display: block;
  font-size: 0.8em;
  font-style: italic;
}

.vc-details-list svg,
.vc-gallery svg {
  width: 1.25rem;
  height: 1.25rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
.vc-details-list summary {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
}

#vcAmenities ul {
  list-style: none;
}
#vcAmenities li {
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}

.vc-gallery > h2 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
}
.vc-gallery ul {
  list-style: none;
  display: flex;
  gap: 1em;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

/* This is an example of how to clip an image into a square shape */
.vc-gallery img {
  width: 265px; /* set the width to the desired size */
  height: 265px; /* set the height to the same value as the width */
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: center;
}

/* Optional re-styling of the open/closed markers for the details elements */

/* First we have to hide the default markers */
.vc-details-list summary::marker,
.vc-details-list summary::-webkit-details-marker {
  display: none;
}
/* then we can use ::after to insert in a new image and position it to the right place */
.vc-details-list summary::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  width: 1.25rem;
  height: 1.25rem;
  background-image: url("../images/arrow.svg");
  background-size: 1.25rem 1.25rem;
  background-position: 0 0;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

/* when you open a details element the browser automatically adds an "open" attribute to the detail.
We can use this with some fancy selector work to change the background position of the arrow image to show the open state. */
.vc-details-list details[open] > summary::after {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

</details>

## **07** Use Javascript to insert data

We now know what the HTML should look like, and we have the data from the API. We need to combine the two now to complete the page. 

>There is a programming principle called "composition". This principle is based on the idea that a complex system can be represented as a collection of smaller, independent components that work together to achieve a common goal.
>
>Here, we will use this principle to break down the task of creating the page into smaller template functions that can be assembled and re-used in whatever way we might need.

Scan over the HTML again and start identifying blocks of related content. This will provide the start to our template function list. Don't stress too much about "getting it right". There is often a lot of opinion in this type of exercise. As long as you are thinking about keeping things simple and making things re-usable you are doing OK.

Here is one potential list of template functions you might make.

- page title template
- Visitor center general info template
- template to create a details box. We do need a bit of flexibility in this one to make it reusable. We need to send in the summary label for the details box, an ID so we can manipulate it with Javascript, the ID for the icon we would like it to use, and finally the content of the details element...in HTML.
- image gallery template
- template to generate a simple HTML list (we will use this for the amenities and gallery sections).
- other templates to generate the content for the detail elements. (Addresses, Contact Information)

>Note that this is not the only way to break this down. And even with this list there is a fair amount of flexibility. For example, how much of the markup should we leave in the HTML file and how much should we generate with Javascript? I'm not sure there is one correct answer for this. You get to decide some of those details, and hopefully you have some justification for each decision you make.

Let's work on the gallery section to get started. The gallery will be a list of images...in the HTML given earlier it looked like this:

```html
<section class="vc-gallery">
<h2>
    <svg class="icon" role="presentation" focusable="false">
    <use
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#camera-alt"
    ></use>
    </svg>
    Image Gallery
</h2>
<ul><li><img src="" alt=""></li></ul>
</section>
```

Most of the markup will stay the same no matter which park we might be looking at, so it makes a certain amount of sense to leave that static markup in the HTML instead of generating it with Javascript.  The actual list of images will change with every park, so that we need to generate. Note as well that we will need another list as well when we create the Amenities section. If possible we should create a function that could create both lists to reuse.  The trick is that the content *inside* the `li` will be different with both lists. So our list template needs to allow for that.

```javascript
export function listTemplate(data, contentTemplate) {
  const html = data.map(contentTemplate);
  return `<ul>${html.join("")}</ul>`;
}
```

Notice that we pass in the template function we want at run time, which makes this function very flexible. So in the case of the images we might use something like:

```javascript
export function vcImageTemplate(data) {
  return `<li><img src="${data.url}" alt="${data.altText}" ><li>`;
}
```

And for the Amenities list we could use this:

```javascript
export function vcAmenityTemplate(data) {
  return `<li>${data}</li>`;
}
```

Putting it all together might look like:

```javascript
  // gallery section
  const galleryHTML = listTemplate(data.images, vcImageTemplate);
  document.querySelector('vc-gallery').insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", galleryHTML);
```
>If you are not familiar with `insertAdjacentHTML` you should become familiar with it. It is much more flexible than just using `innerHTML`, and has better performance. [insertAdjacentHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)

We can't finish the Amenities quite yet. It is also inside of a `details` element. One of the things on our list of templates was a function that would produce the HTML to build that element. To review the markup looks like this:

```html
<details name="vc-details" id="vcAmenities">
    <summary>
    <svg class="icon" role="presentation" focusable="false">
        <use
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#heading-icon_info"
        ></use>
    </svg>
    Amenities
    </summary>
    <ul>
    <li>All</li>
    <li>the</li>
    <li>amenities</li>
    </ul>
</details>
```

There are four sections that are very similar. To make a function that could be used for all four sections we will need to send in a fair amount of info: an `id` unique to the section, the icon id we would like to use, the text for the `summary`, and the actual content. In this example the content will be a `ul` with all the amenities in it.

Create the remaining template functions in `templates.mjs`, then create a function in `visitor-center.js` that we will use to call all of the related template functions to build the complete page. Test to make sure that the info all loads correctly.

>For the contacts, just grab the first email and first phone number in the lists (most only have one).

  const image = data.images[0];

## **08** Stretch - Add the Hours and Seasons info

This step is optional. If you are up for a bit of a challenge, implement the Hours and Seasons section.


## **09** Commit and push to Github

Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes then check to make sure they show on Netlify.

After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your page in Ilearn. This will be the Netlify URL we setup earlier.

## Instructor's Solution
