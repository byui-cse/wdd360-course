## Instructions

Complete the following assignment individually. Feel free however to work together with your classmates to accomplish the task. You are all solving the same problems and have different insights.

## **01** Review the provided screenshots

Review the following screenshot to see where we will be when we finish this activity.

import Figure from "../../components/Figure.astro";

<Figure src="/images/nps-menu-simple-open.webp" alt="Menu simple open state">Menu Simple open state</Figure>


Here are a few things in particular to note:

- We will focus primarily on the second section: "Explore the National Park Service".
- As we are not making any of the pages these links target, you can just set the href to "#", or if you would rather you could link them to the actual NPS pages.
- The NPS page uses accordians to hide and show menus on the mobile view to keep the page from becoming overwhelming. 
- On the widescreen view the links are all shown.
- Note that the second section is the only one that remains in the top global navigation on wide screens as well.

You were given some of the code for the navigation already. If you look in the `index.html` file you will see the following:

```html
<div class="global-header__right">
  <a class="search-icon" href="#park-footer">
    <svg class="icon">
      <use
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#search"
      ></use>
    </svg>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Search</span>
  </a>
  <button id="global-nav-toggle" >
      <svg class="icon">
        <use
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
          xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#menu"
        ></use>
      </svg>
      <span class="visually-hidden">Open</span> Menu
  </button>
</div>
<nav class="global-nav">
    <h2 class="global-nav__section-heading">Explore this Park</h2>
    <ul class="global-nav__list">
    <li>
        <div class="global-nav__split-button">
        <a href="#">Plan Your Visit</a>
        <button class="global-nav__split-button__toggle">
            <span class="visually-hidden"
            >Toggle submenu for Plan Your Visit</span
            >
            <svg class="icon" role="presentation" focusable="false">
              <use xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#arrow"></use>
            </svg>
        </button>
        </div>
    </li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```
Note the button that will open and close the main menu. It has a menu icon, and the word "Menu". If you go and check an [official page](https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm) however you will find that the icon and word change when the menu is open. We will need to modify our HTML to accomodate this.

Notice as well in the `.global-nav` section that each major link category is made up of an anchor and a button. On mobile click the button will toggle the list of links open and closed. On wide screens the button will be hidden and the links all shown. It would be worth opening up one of the official NPS sites to look at the rest of the structure in the HTML for those menus. The major thing that we are missing in our page is the actual list of links.

This assignment will be broken into two parts because of the scope. This part will work on getting the main menu to open and close, along with adding an Animation, and changing the button label depending on the current state of the menu. The next part will complete the submenus.

{/* It was mentioned above that we will focus on the Second section, so we won't add any more HTML for the first. If we do our classnames and styling correct however the first section should get styled correctly when we style the second.  */}

Remember to type `npm run start` to start up your development server. 

## **02** Complete the HTML for the Menu button

Working in the `index.html` file, add the HTML to the `global-nav-toggle` button. We should start by adding an element to group up the current contents of the `button`. Add a class to the grouping element so we can easily grab it later with Javascript. 

1. We should start by adding an element to group up the current contents of the `button`. Add a class to the grouping element so we can easily grab it later with Javascript. 
2. Duplicate the new element (the icon and words) and then change the class identifying it, as well as the icon (note that there is an icon in the .svg file called `close`), and the "Menu" to "Close"
3. There is an id on the actual button Element, and that will be good for selecting with Javascript, but it would be good to add a class as well. Something like `global-nav__toggle` would fit in well with the other existing class names.
4. While we are at it we should also add a couple of attributes to the button for accessibility.  `aria-expanded="false"` and `aria-label="Open Menu"`. We will need to change the `aria-expanded` to `true` when the menu gets opened.

*After* you have completed your version of this step, take a look at the example below.

Menu toggle button changes:

```html
<button
    id="global-nav-toggle"
    class="global-nav__toggle"
    aria-expanded="false"
    aria-label="Open Menu"
     >
    <div class="global-nav__toggle--closed">
        <svg class="icon">
        <use
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
            xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#menu"
        ></use>
        </svg>
        <span class="visually-hidden">Open</span> Menu
    </div>
    <div class="global-nav__toggle--open">
        <svg class="icon">
        <use
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
            xlink:href="/images/sprite.symbol.svg#close"
        ></use>
        </svg>
        Close
    </div>
</button>
 ```

</details>


## **03** Style

It would be worth making a list of what needs to happen for our menu to function correctly. We will be approaching this mobile first, so lets first make a list of what needs to happen for that to look right

1. Hide the main menu and submenus by default.
2. Hide the close word and icon by default.
3. When the "Menu" (`global-nav__toggle`) button is clicked show the main navigation (`.global-nav`), hide the "Menu" icon, and show the "Close" icon. We should also set 'aria-expanded' to true when the menu opens. When clicked again reverse everything.
3. Add a transition to the menubar. It should slide down when opened and slide back up when closed.

>What does `aria-expanded` do?
>
>`aria-expanded` is an attribute that is used to indicate whether a menu is expanded or collapsed. It is used by screen readers to let their users know the current state of a menu or other collapsable elements.

That doesn't look too bad. Begin writing the CSS that will style the menu button. Hide the close icon. Then make sure that the `global-nav` element is hidden.

>How should we hide the menus?
>
>As you decide how to hide your submenus keep in mind that eventually we want the menus to slide open. Your first impulse might be to just do `display:none` on the element. This will indeed hide it, but you will run into problems later when you want to animate the opening and closing. What else could be done?
>
>We could reduce the height to 0, then restore it back to the right height when clicked...the problem is how tall should it be? If we set it to a value and the menu changes it will break. It would be a brittle solution. If we try and set the height back to `auto` (the default) we will find that the animation will not work.
>
>Another option we have though is `max-height`. If we set that to 0, then set it to something bigger than we need, it will animate!

We will also address steps 3, 4 in the next sections.

Once you are done styling (or if you get stuck) compare with the example below. Remember to **not** copy and paste the code. You will gain much more if you review the example and then fix your code. The goal here is not to simply finish the activity, but to learn more about web development.

<summary>Example 2</summary>

### styles.css

```css
/* Global nav styles */

.global-nav {
  width: 100%;
  grid-column: 1/3;
  border-top: 1px solid #333;
  max-height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  
}

.global-nav__toggle--closed {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
.global-nav__toggle--open {
  display: none;
  align-items: center;
}


```

## **04** Javascript: enable the main menu button

We need some Javascript to enable the button to actually be able to show and hide our menu. Attach an event listener to the main menu button `#global-nav-toggle`. Then write a function that will do the actual hiding and showing. How can we accomplish this? Well in the previous step it was recommended that you reduce the `max-height` to 0. So an easy way to undo this would be to add a class that will set the max-height to something greater than 0. You will need to add the class in your CSS as well.

We also need to check to see if the menu is open or closed after the click. If it is open we need to set `aria-expanded` to `true`.

Here is a function stub to get you started on writing the event handler. You can do your initial building and testing with the code in `main.js`.

```javascript
function enableNavigation() {
  // use a querySelector to get the menu buttons
    
  // when the main menu button is clicked:
  menuButton.addEventListener("click", (ev) => {
    let target = ev.target;
    // toggle the show class on the global-nav

    // check to see if target is the button or something inside the button
    
    // check to see if we just opened or closed the menu
    
      // if we opened it then set the aria-expanded attribute on the button to true
      
      // if we closed it then set the aria-expanded attribute on the button to false
      
  });
}
```

>Caution!
>
>When we click on the button we might also be clicking on the text inside the button!  In that case `ev.target` might not point to what we think it does. Before you try to set the `aria-expanded` attribute you should check to make sure we have the right target.  Each element has a property called `tagName` that you can use to check. We are looking for a "BUTTON". If `ev.target` isn't a button, it means we clicked on something inside the button and we can use `Element.closest()` to get back up to the button element we were expecting.

Finally we need to make sure that the text on the button changes as well.

For the button text we could add/remove classes to the elements, but there is actually a better way. We can take advantage of the fact that we are setting `aria-expanded` based on the menu state, and that the elements we want to show and hide are children of the button. We can use a [attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) to write the CSS to swap our labels.

```CSS
.global-nav__toggle[aria-expanded="true"] > .global-nav__toggle--open {
  display: flex;
}
```

>You would read that selector like this: "Find the element with a class of `global-nav__toggle--open` that is the child of an element that has a class of `global-nav__toggle` **and** an attribute `aria-expanded=true` "

You will need another rule for the closed Element.

One you have the buttons working, add a transition to make the menu slide open over time instead of instantly.

### main.js

```javascript
function enableNavigation() {
  const menuButton = document.querySelector("#global-nav-toggle");
  
  // when the main menu button is clicked:
  menuButton.addEventListener("click", (ev) => {
    let target = ev.target;
  // toggle the show class on the global-nav
  document.querySelector(".global-nav").classList.toggle("show");
  // check to see if ev.target is the button or something inside the button
  if (target.tagName != "BUTTON") {
    target = target.closest("button");
  }
  // check to see if we just opened or closed the menu
  if (document.querySelector(".global-nav").classList.contains("show")) {
    // if we opened it then set the aria-expanded attribute to true
    target.setAttribute("aria-expanded", true);
  } else {
    // if we closed it then set the aria-expanded attribute to false
    target.setAttribute("aria-expanded", false);
  }

  console.log("toggle");
  });
}
```

### styles.css

```css
/* Global nav styles */

.global-nav {
  width: 100%;
  grid-column: 1/3;
  border-top: 1px solid #333;
  max-height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: all 0.5s;
}

.global-nav button {
  background-color: transparent;
  border: 0;
  padding: 1rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.global-nav svg {
  --icon-color: white;
}

.global-nav__toggle--closed {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
.global-nav__toggle--open {
  display: none;
  align-items: center;
}

.global-nav__toggle[aria-expanded="true"] .global-nav__toggle--closed {
  display: none;
}
.global-nav__toggle[aria-expanded="true"] .global-nav__toggle--open {
  display: flex;
}

.global-nav.show {
  max-height: 1000px;
}
```
