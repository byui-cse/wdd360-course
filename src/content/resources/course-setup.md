## Core Requirements

1. ### Code Editor

    It is important that you have a good code editor and that you spend some time learning how to use it. For this course it is recommended that you use the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor. Download and install it now if you do not have it.

    I would also recommend reviewing [the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) if you have not.

2. ### Node/NPM

    Have each member of the team install the current LTS (Long Term Support) version of node. Follow the instructions for your operating system found in this [Node setup page](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/node-installation/).

    Make sure that you are familiar with how to use the command prompt for your operating system. Here are some quickstarts for the [command line for Mac](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/cli-basics/prepare1/) and the [command line for Windows](https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/cli-basics/prepare1/) if you need a review.

3. ### Git and GitHub

    Each person should also have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and have an account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

    You can tell whether you already have Git by opening a terminal (Mac) or CMD prompt/Powershell (Windows) and typing `git --version`. If you get an error, you need to install it.

4. ### Microsoft Teams

    A Microsoft Team has been setup for this course, and you should have been added to it. Download [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) and sign in with your university account. You should see a team named `WDD360.x semester` (If it were Fall 2020, and you are in section 1 the name would be `WDD360.01 F20`). Post a message in the General channel indicating that you are in.

5. ### Form a Team

    Much of the work for the course will be done in a team. Form a team with 2-3 of your classmates (total team size should be 3-4). If you have trouble finding a team talk to the instructor. Once your team is formed, send an email to the instructor with the names of the members in your team.

    Remember that everyone should be in Microsoft Teams now as well...you could post a message there: 'Looking for team.'

    If you would like a private channel for your team in Microsoft Teams, let the instructor know in your email.
