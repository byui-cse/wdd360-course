## Description

This course offers a comprehensive study of modern web application development, focusing on both front-end and back-end technologies. Students will learn to create dynamic, interactive web applications using industry-standard tools and frameworks.

The course will cover topics such as:

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building responsive user interfaces
* Front-end development both with vanilla Javascript and frameworks
* Back-end development with Node.js and Express.js for building RESTful APIs
* Database design and integration using NoSQL databases
* User authentication and authorization using modern practices
* Deployment strategies and best practices for web applications

A key aspect of the course will be teamwork and collaboration. Students will work in teams to complete a series of real-world projects, simulating a professional development environment. Emphasis will be placed on effective communication, project management, and version control using tools such as Git and GitHub.

By the end of the course, students will have gained valuable experience in full-stack web development and be well-equipped to tackle complex web projects in a professional setting.

## Prerequisites

**WDD 230/231 AND CSE 340** – It is expected that you have learned and mastered the information made available to you in WDD 230/231, CSE 340, and its prerequisite courses. If you feel rusty, the following is a more specific list of topics you would have been introduced to in those courses that will be important that you are comfortable with, and some sources to use for review before the course begins.

1. Make sure you have a good understanding of variables, scope, and template literals in JavaScript. If you need a review in any of those areas read [Grammar and Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types).
2. Make sure you have a good understanding of Array methods such as `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.sort()`. If you need a review either read [15 Must-Know JavaScript Array Methods](https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-06-05-15-must-know-javascript-array-methods/) OR complete the [Array Cardio Day 1 lesson](https://javascript30.com) from JavaScript30.com.
3. Make sure you recognize and can use the three main function forms in JavaScript (declaration, expression, arrow). You should also understand the concept of callbacks. If you need a review you can read [MDN Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) and [JavaScript Callbacks](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-callback/).
4. Make sure you are comfortable with basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript. If you need a review you can read [MDN Manipulating Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents).
5. Make sure you are comfortable with basic event management with JavaScript. If you need a review you can read [MDN Introduction to Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events).
6. You should also be comfortable starting up a NodeJS server and running a simple Express app. If you need a review you can read [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html).

## Software and Resources

We will be using free materials and resources from the internet in this course. 

1. Google Chrome Web Browser
2. A GitHub account and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) set up on your computer
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer
4. [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) account (free tier is fine)
5. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) installed
6. [Trello](https://trello.com) account (free tier is fine)

You will also want a good text editor installed on your computer. If you don’t have one you are already invested in I would recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Free, Mac/Windows/Linux, a good general purpose editor with great Git support.

## Course Structure

### Overview

This class has an unusual course design. It is designed to introduce you to the tools, workflows, and problems common in modern Web Development. We will spend the first 9 weeks of the course in teams working on a project modeled off of real world projects. The goal is to create an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer, and your team is a source of strength instead of frustration. Using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript you will explore technologies and use them to resolve problems that arise naturally. You will also learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through creating Full stack Web applications.

For weeks 10-14 of the course you will further apply what you have learned by designing and completing a project of your choosing. This project will be with your team.

During the first nine weeks your time will be spent on a weekly reading assignment, a weekly Team activity, and additional tasks (found in a Trello board of which each team will make a copy) that add more functionality to our site. Each person in the team should have a goal of completing at least one card (task) per week.

1. Reading assignment: 1-2hrs
2. Team activity: ~2hrs (If face-to-face 1hr of this will be classtime)
3. Individual assignments: ~3hrs
4. Professor led instruction: ~1-1.5hrs (either scheduled class or a weekly recorded office hour if online)

## Outcomes

By taking advantage of the opportunities this course presents, you will develop fundamental knowledge and skills in computing and technology and improve your professional possibilities by:

1. Build APIs using modern back-end technologies 
2. Write dynamic web front-ends that consume APIs
3. Design and integrate a NoSQL database into a web application.
4. Use modern practices for authentication, authorization, and data protection
5. Deploy web applications 
6. Collaborate with a team on a common codebase

These outcomes support both the [CIT Department and BYU-Idaho student learning outcomes](universityandcitoutcomes.pdf). The activities and assessments for this course are designed to give you opportunities to achieve these outcomes and evaluate you against them. If you desire a different set of evaluations and assignments, you may propose them to the instructor (during the first or second week of the semester) but your proposal must cover ALL of the course's outcomes in significant ways and to a significant depth. Do not propose a "check list" of do-once-and-forget activities. These will not be approved.

## Learning Model Architecture

### Prepare

Each week you will work directly with your team. You help your team become successful if you come prepared for these team meetings. This preparation includes thinking about the technologies you are exploring, completing the assignments given during the previous team meeting, and doing the necessary research to plan the next steps for your team. Just as in life, if you do more than fulfill the minimum requirements assigned to you, you will be more successful in your team and in the class. Magnify your professional calling.

### Teach One Another

Team meetings and a collaborative environment have been established to enable each of you to draw from the strengths of others so that your weaknesses can become strengths. This requires effort on the part of both the knower and the learner so that 'both [may be] edified' (see Doctrine and Covenants 50:22).

### Ponder/Prove

Pondering is integral to success in both this course and life. You should be pondering and reflecting not only on what you are learning but how you are learning it. Self-understanding is vital to professional life. It is also fundamental to our eternal exaltation.

Proving is also integral to success. You should prove what you think you know through experimentation. Just finding an example of some principle on the web or from your team is insufficient for successful learning. You must be playing with and generating your own examples to understand how technologies work and what they do. This way you become a blessing to yourself and your current and future team members.

## Grading Policy

At the end of each challenge, you have an opportunity for me to evaluate, with you, where you are in your learning and the accomplishment of the outcomes for the course. You must request this review. I will not force a review with you if you do not request one. You must be proactive in scheduling this evaluation. The results of this evaluation will not be recorded or become part of your grade.

**At midterm and again at the end of the semester** I will ask you to turn in your ranking of yourself on the course outcomes, with a portfolio of your work to back yourself up. I recommend building this as you go. Your final grade will be based off of these two artifacts.
