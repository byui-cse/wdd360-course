## Topics

If you want to find your own sources and learn in your own way, here is the list of topics.

1. "this" in Javascript
2. Closures
3. Rest and Spread syntax

## Reading

...Or if you would rather here is a list of short articles to read about the topics.

1. Read [Object Methods, "this"](https://javascript.info/object-methods)
    If the concept of `this` still is a bit unclear, you can continue with either this article: [This in Javascript](https://zellwk.com/blog/this/) OR this video [What is THIS in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVXp7ZWjlO4) (The concepts in the video are very well explained...but there are a
            couple of 'bleeped' out profanities! )
2. Read [Closures](https://javascript.info/closure)
3. Read [Rest and Spread syntax](https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread)
