## Reading

...Or if you would rather here is a list of short articles to read about the topics.

1. Review [Fetch](https://javascript.info/fetch)
2. Read [CORS](https://javascript.info/fetch-crossorigin)
3. Read [Object Methods, "this"](https://javascript.info/object-methods)
    If the concept of `this` still is a bit unclear, you can continue with either this article: [This in Javascript](https://zellwk.com/blog/this/) OR this video [What is THIS in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVXp7ZWjlO4) (The concepts in the video are very well explained...but there are a
            couple of 'bleeped' out profanities! )
4. Review [Form properties and methods](https://javascript.info/form-elements)
5. Watch [Using FormData Objects Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWJhE7Licjs) OR Read [FormData](https://javascript.info/formdata)
