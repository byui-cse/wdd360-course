> ### Tips
>
>- Read for understanding, not completion. This means that some weeks when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through the reading. Other weeks you might have to read several times...and spend lots of time working through the code examples until you understand. You may even need to go find a few extra sources on your own for some topics.
>- Don't skip the code examples! Make sure to spend time reviewing these. With the book we are using you can actually interact with the code samples directly. If you have time you should also work through the exercises at the end of each chapter.
>- Take good notes! One of the most important things that you can include in your notes are questions that arise in your mind as you read. Having this list will help you to know what topics need more time, and will give you something to say when the instructor asks: "Do you have any questions from the reading?"
>- There is not a specific list of exercises given because *not everyone needs the same thing*. This course
is designed to give you the flexibility to spend your time in the areas you need, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach
where you spend all your time for the week on concepts that you may have already mastered. This approach will frustrate some of you, but becomes very powerful once you adjust to it.
>For example, you might read through the chapter on Functions and maybe the author's explanation left some questions in your mind about arguments. So you do a quick search which turns up this article about [How to Use ES6 Arguments and Parameters](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/how-to-use-arguments-and-parameters-in-ecmascript-6/). Then you visit the list of exercises below and find this list of [JavaScript Functions](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php) that will give you as much practice as you need writing functions that use arguments and parameters.
>- Again, don't be afraid to find your own sources! Sometimes the way an author explains a concept will not compute with your brain. Go find another explanation! As a starting point, here are some additional resources you have free access to:
>    * [Modern Javascript Tutorial (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info) (SitePoint)
>    * [Eloquent JavaScript (EJS)](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html)
>    * [You Don't Know JS Yet](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
>    * [Exploring ES6](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html#toc_ch_overviews)
>    * [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

## Topics

If you want to find your own sources and learn in your own way, here is the list of topics.

1. Different ways to modify the Document with Javascript
2. LocalStorage and SessionStorage

## Reading

...Or if you would rather here is a list of short articles to read about the topics.

1. Review [1.7 Modifying the document](https://javascript.info/modifying-document). This should be mostly review, but pay special attention to the `insertAdjacentHTML` section.
2. Review [4.2 LocalStorage, sessionStorage](https://javascript.info/localstorage).
3. Read [4.6 Optional chaining '?.'](https://javascript.info/optional-chaining).
4. Read [13.2 Modules: Import and Export](https://javascript.info/import-export).
5. Read [Typescript for Javascript Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
